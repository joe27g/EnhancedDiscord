## END OF SUPPORT
__EnhancedDiscord is being shut down.__ It's been nice while it lasted, but we can't keep up with the maintenance that Discord's constant changes require. There won't be any more updates, and on **April 12th**, all support will be dropped and the site will go offline. We recommend you find another client mod that is actively maintained.
